In this project, we analyze an A/B test where the placement of the first progression gate in the mobile game Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. We aim to assess the impact of this change on player retention and gameplay frequency to determine if it enhances player engagement and in-game purchasing behavior.
